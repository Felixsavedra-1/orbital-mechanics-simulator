- Uses actual astronomical data and Newtonian physics
- Foundation for comprehensive space mission planning system

## Current Caluclations 
- Mercury through Neptune orbital velocities
- Based on gravitational physics: v = √(GM/r)

## Planned Features
- Moon and ISS orbital data
- Space station logistics planning
- Mission resource management
- Fuel calculations
- Visual orbital simulation

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Mathematics and physics modelings
